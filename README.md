# Quantum pathfinder: the vehicle routing optimal solver

Quantum pathfinder is a optimization tool designed to find the optimal set of routes for a number of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers. Quantum Pathfinder uses a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (**QUBO**) representation of the well-known problem of the Vehicle Routing Problem [VRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) and solves it using the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm **(QAOA)**. We compare the results using QAOA and CPLEX a classical solver.
